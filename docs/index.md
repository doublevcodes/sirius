# Sirius

*Sirius: create APIs that shine like a star*

---

Sirius, commonly known as the brightest star in the night sky, is also an API framework written with ease-of-use and developer experience in mind. By learning from frameworks written not only in Python, but other languages too, Sirius provides a set of distinctive features aiming to provide the best possible experience developing a dazzling application on a starry night.

## Key features

Sirius aims to take developer experience to the next level and so it provides a set of features aiming to provide a developer with little to no headaches! Some of these include, but aren't limited to:

- **File-based routing**: Perhaps what sets Sirius apart from the rest, this allows the developer to watch their API grow - inside a directory!
- **A zero-boilerplate experience**: With this, all one has to do is `pip install sirius-api`, and the rest will be done for you. Simple applications don't even need to import Sirius!
- **A CLI utility**: Don't want to programmatically be running Sirius with calls to the framework? Easy, open a terminal and `sirius dev` will do the job for you.

## Requirements

Sirius aims to be next-generation and so currently only supports **Python 3.10**. Backwards compatibility to older Python versions may be introduced at a later date.

You don't need to install any external packages to run a Sirius application... apart from Sirius ðŸ˜….

## Installation

Simple:

```zsh
python3 -m pip install sirius
```

...and you're ready to dive into an astronomical world of fun!

## Example

### Build it

A simple Sirius API that defines a root endpoint (`/`) that responds to `GET` requests with a message would look like the following:

```py
def get():
    return "Astronomically amazing!"
```

!!! note "Where does this go in my project?"

    The file this would be found in relative to your project would be `./routes/__init__.py`. as you'll soon lean, a file named `__init__.py` in Sirius represents a root endpoint. Keep flying! You're nearly there!
